<h2>About {{project_name}}</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>{{project_name}} is a project by <a
href="http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/~lljy/">Lars Yencken</a> and <a
href="http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/~tim/">Timothy Baldwin</a> at the
University of Melbourne which provides online tests of Japanese vocabulary
and kanji knowledge. Unlike paper tests, these test are:</p>
<ul class="text">
  <li><em>Automated</em>, so you don't need a teacher or instructor to
  administrate them</li> 
  <li><em>Randomised</em>, so you can do them as often as you like and still
  get an honest score</li>
  <li><em>Adaptive</em>, so that the more you times you make a mistake, the
  more you get drilled on that mistake
</ul>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to get information on the types of
mistakes that people make as they learn Japanese, and the extent to which we
can predict those mistakes. The more closely we can model learner behaviour,
the more difficult and stimulating we can make this form of testing.</p>

<h3>Current limitations</h3>
<p>We currently only support testing for JLPT levels 3 and 4, though we're keen
on supporting other resources in the future. The main obstacle for us is
obtaining the vocabulary and kanji lists. If you want support for such a
resource, and are willing to type in the vocabulary list, feel free to <a
href="mailto:lljy@csse.unimelb.edu.au">contact us</a>.</p>
